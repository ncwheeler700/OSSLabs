#### 1. Why is it important to choose a LICENSE:
Having a license on a project is important because it lays out a contract for
the creator and anyone who decides to work on the project. That way, both the
creator of the project and any other contributors have a clear understanding
of how the project can be developed and used.

#### 2. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
Working on a project without a set license means that you are putting blind faith
in the future of the project. Since the creator has the sole copyright, he/she could
decide to pull the rug out from under the contributors, take all their work,
sell it as a proprietary product, and be completely within his/her rights.

#### 3. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?
I do agree that the difference in approach between the web and Gopher contributed
to Gopher's premature obsoletion. Because of the massive potential and scope the web
had (and still as), the Gopher team couldn't have possibly in-housed the project in
timely manner, which led to their falling behind and eventual failure.

#### 4. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of Linux?
The GPL license for Linux makes perfect sense because it aligns with the goals of
the project. Linux is meant to free and open-source forever and always. GPL allows
the source to be released without any risk of being used for in a commercial sense.
The main distinguisher of the GPL license is that any derivative work must also
carry the GPL license, which means that any form of Linux has to have the GPL license.

#### 5. Think of an example project for your Table. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github. Write five sentences about choosing a project to work on in this course, who will be users/customers of such a project, and what license you would choose.
Twitterbot - We would use the MIT license for this project because we want the project to be permissive but still give us copyright credit. We also don't plan on monetizing it which is where the Apache/BSD license would come in handy with a patent license. The project would mostly be used by people who want a quick and easy way to get an image-based twitterbot up and running. People could also use our project to derive their own bots for other kinds of uses like videos and RSS feeds.

#### 6. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good
The MIT is perfect for an indie dev because it's short and permissive, and requires
credit given where credit is due. It allows for forking, branching, and basically anything else so long as the original copyright and license are included.
GPLv2 is the best for the common good because it is completely permissive to the public. However it ensures that any derivations of the project also have the GPLv2, which prevents it from being relicensed into something proprietary.
The best license for a company fronting an open source project would be the Apache/BSD license since it is permissive, but it also includes a patent lawsuit to help fend off problematic and frivolous lawsuits.
